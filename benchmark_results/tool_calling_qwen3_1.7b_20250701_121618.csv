Okay, the user is asking about the weather in New York City. Let me check the available tools. There's a function called get_weather that requires a location. The parameters need the location as a string, like ""San Francisco, CA"". The user specified New York City, so I should use that. They didn't mention the unit, but the function has an enum for celsius or fahrenheit. Since the user didn't specify, maybe I should default to celsius? Or maybe leave it out? Wait, the required field is just location, so maybe the unit is optional. But the function's parameters list unit as required? Wait, no, looking back, the parameters for get_weather have ""required"": [""location""], and ""unit"" is a property but not required. So the user can choose either unit. Since they didn't specify, I can include the default, maybe fahrenheit? Or maybe just provide the location and let the function handle the unit.

Okay, the user wants to know how much to tip on a $42.75 bill at 18%. Let me see. The function to use here is calculate_tip. The parameters needed are bill_amount and tip_percentage. The bill amount is $42.75, which is a number, and the tip percentage is 18, also a number. So I need to call the calculate_tip function with those values. Let me check if there are any other parameters, but the required ones are bill_amount and tip_percentage. So the arguments should be {""bill_amount"": 42.75, ""tip_percentage"": 18}. That's all. I don't need to use the other functions like get_weather or send_email here. Just calculate the tip.

Okay, the user is asking about the weather in New York City. Let me check the available tools. There's a function called get_weather that requires a location. The parameters need the location as a string, like ""San Francisco, CA"". The user specified New York City, so I should use that. They didn't mention the unit, so maybe default to Celsius? Wait, the enum in the function includes both celsius and fahrenheit. Since the user didn't specify, perhaps I should ask for the unit. But the instructions say to call the function with the provided parameters. Oh, the user didn't mention the unit, so maybe the function can handle it without. Wait, the function's required parameters are only location. The unit is optional. So I can call get_weather with location as ""New York City"" and unit as ""celsius"" or ""fahrenheit"". But since the user didn't specify, maybe the default is celsius? Or maybe the function can return either. The user might not know, but the function's description says it's the current weather. Maybe the unit is optional, so I can just provide the location. Let me check the function's parameters again. The unit is an enum, but not required. So I can call the function with just the location. So the tool call would be get_weather with arguments {""location"": ""New York City""}.

Okay, the user wants to calculate a 20% tip on a $85.50 bill. Let me see which tool to use. The available functions are get_weather, calculate_tip, and send_email. The calculate_tip function seems right here.

The parameters needed are bill_amount and tip_percentage. The bill amount is $85.50, so the bill_amount should be 85.50. The tip percentage is 20, so tip_percentage is 20. I need to make sure the arguments are in the correct format. The function requires numbers, so both values are numbers. 

I should call calculate_tip with these values. Let me check if there's any other parameters needed, but the function's parameters only require those two. So the tool call should be calculate_tip with arguments { ""bill_amount"": 85.50, ""tip_percentage"": 20 }.
