Looking at the parameters for calculate_tip, it requires bill_amount and tip_percentage. The bill amount here is $42.75, and the tip percentage is 18%. I need to make sure the arguments are in the correct format. The bill_amount is a number, which 42.75 is, and tip_percentage is also a number, 18. So I should structure the JSON with those values. Let me double-check the function's required parameters to ensure I'm not missing anything. Yep, both are required. Alright, I'll format the tool call with those numbers.

Okay, the user is asking about the weather in New York City. Let me check which tool I can use for that. Oh, there's the get_weather function. It requires the location parameter, so I need to specify ""New York City"" there. The unit is optional, but since the user didn't specify, I'll default to celsius. Let me make sure the parameters are correct. Location is a string, and unit is from the enum. Alright, I should call get_weather with location: ""New York City"" and unit: ""celsius"".

Okay, the user is asking for the temperature in Los Angeles in Celsius. Let me check which tool I can use here. The available tools are get_weather, calculate_tip, and send_email. The get_weather function seems relevant here because it's for getting the current weather for a location. 

Looking at the parameters for get_weather, it requires the location and has an optional unit parameter with an enum of celsius or fahrenheit. The user specifically asked for Celsius, so I need to make sure to include that in the arguments.

The location should be ""Los Angeles, CA"" to specify the city and state. So the function call would be get_weather with location set to ""Los Angeles, CA"" and unit set to ""celsius"". I should structure the JSON accordingly within the tool_call tags.
